# Flutter Firebase Phone Auth Starter

## Why?

When I searched for a simple, drop-in placement for a Phone Authentication using Firebase in Flutter for
a college project, I couldn't find any. That's how this starter template came into being.

## What's included?

- A full-fledged Phone Authentication flow with the UI.
- Two Screens - Login and a generic Home Page.
- Management of Authentication State
